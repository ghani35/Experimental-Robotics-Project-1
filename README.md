# Introduction 
This github repository shows how to build a finit-state machine in ROS environment based on [SMACH](http://wiki.ros.org/smach/Tutorials) ros-package, and how to build a topological onotology of the wrold, in this small project, Protogé is used for building the ontology, [ARMOR](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_rds_tutorial) service is used for access and modify the ontology.
#### Environment
 It is a 2D-environmen built up with 4 rooms `R1 R2 R3 R4`, 2 corridors `C1 C2` and one special room `E` used as a waiting room befor filling the map, and a charging station as well. And 7 doors `D1 ... D7`  
#### Senario
 We have a survallience robot that moves in a 2D environment. First the robot waits in room **E** untill the whol map  is loaded into the ontology, then the robot keeps moving between the corridors **C1** and **C2** for infinit time. The robot must go to the charging station **E** when its battery is low, otherwise he must visit the **urgent** rooms if any, then goes back to its normal behavior moving between cooridors.
